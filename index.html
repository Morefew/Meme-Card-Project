            Welcome to our collaborative learning journey! This project aims to teach you the fundamentals of Git for version control and GitHub for team collaboration.
            Each participant will contribute a unique "Meme Card" to this page, showcasing their understanding of the workflow from cloning to pull requests.
        </p>
        <p class="page-info">
            This page is the live, collective result of everyone's contributions. As each meme card is added and merged, it will magically appear here!
